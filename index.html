                <p>Our data analysis were done in Python and can be found at our <a href="" target="_blank">notebook</a>. The notebook will elaborate on what is contained within the datasets and how the code is working. </p>
                <p>The this project was tackle is different from what was stated in the video. The focus on restuarant have been changed to all the type of business that is available in the datasets and given the size of the data will there only be focused on the state PA. The process for gathered information will be done in such a way that it is possible to use the same method for the  data not processed.</p>
                
                <p>The original data for this project can be found at <a href="https://www.yelp.dk/dataset_challenge/dataset">dataset challenge</a> and the data which is used in the jupyter notebook can be found at <a href=""> this link.</a></p>
